        <h2>About the Instructor</h2>
        <img src="photos/lunch.jpg" alt="Instructor Photo">
        <p>Hi, I'm Iljya Kalai, your sailing instructor. I have always enjoyed teaching and have hosted many sailors on my first boat, Smetana, with which I sailed from Italy to New Zealand via Brazil and the Panama Canal. My second boat, Manuel o Audaz, brought me down to the Canary Islands from Spain during the off-season. With my extensive sailing experience and passion for teaching, I look forward to guiding you through this enriching journey.</p>
